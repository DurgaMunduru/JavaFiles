//  => Interface:   An interface is a blueprint of class and interfaces is like business logic methods are written
//              difference btw class and interface is in class, implementation of the methods also but in interface ,
//                  only the business methods are there
//
//      simply, In interface : what to do(Only required methods)
//              In class : how to do and what to do also if required
//      Interfaces contains both abstract methods and static constants
//      Interfaces is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance also to achieve loose coupling
